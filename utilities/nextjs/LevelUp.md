## Fresher (Entry-Level)

- Goals: Master the basics of React and Next.js. Build small projects.
- Key Learning Areas:
  - React Basics:
    - JSX, Components, Props, State, and Events.
    - Functional Components and Hooks (useState, useEffect).
    - Conditional Rendering and Lists.
  - Next.js Basics:
    - Pages and Routing (pages/ directory, dynamic routes).
    - Static Site Generation (SSG) and Server-Side Rendering (SSR).
    - API Routes (/api).
  - Styling:
    - CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS, or Styled Components.
  - Tooling:
    - Basic usage of npm/yarn and version control with Git.
  - Practice:
    - Build a personal portfolio site or a blog with SSG.
- Suggested Projects:
  - Todo App.
  - Weather App (using API routes).
  - Blog with Markdown (SSG and dynamic routes). Here all Public API free for practising: https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis

## Junior Developer
