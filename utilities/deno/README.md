# Deno Notes

## Core Philosophy

1. **Security**: Deno is designed with a secure-by-default approach. It requires explicit permission for file system access, network access, and environment variable access, minimizing the risks of vulnerabilities commonly found in applications.
2. **Simplicity and Modernity**: Deno simplifies development by using modern JavaScript and TypeScript out of the box. It has a built-in TypeScript compiler, which allows developers to write TypeScript without additional setup.
3. **Single Executable**: Deno is distributed as a single executable file, making it easy to install and manage. This contrasts with Node.js, which often requires multiple packages and dependencies.
4. **Module System**: Deno uses ES modules (ECMAScript modules) for dependency management, promoting the use of URLs for importing modules rather than a centralized package manager like npm. This approach aligns with the modern JavaScript ecosystem.
5. **Built-in Tools**: Deno includes built-in tools for testing, formatting, linting, and bundling, providing a comprehensive development experience without relying on external tools.
6. **Asynchronous Programming**: Deno embraces asynchronous programming patterns, promoting the use of Promises and async/await syntax to handle asynchronous operations.
7. **First-Class TypeScript Support**: Deno has first-class support for TypeScript, allowing developers to leverage static typing and improved tooling while building applications.
