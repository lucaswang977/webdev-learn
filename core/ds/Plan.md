## Data Structure 12-month Learning Plan

### Phase 1: Foundations (Months 1-3)

Objective: Strengthen the basics of data structures and algorithms.

1. Month 1: Basics of Data Structures

   - Week 1: Arrays and Strings (Practice traversal, manipulation, sliding window)
   - Week 2: Linked Lists (Single, Double, and Circular)
   - Week 3: Stacks and Queues (Implementation and applications)
   - Week 4: Hash Maps and Hash Sets (Common use cases and collision handling)
   - Practice: Solve 3-5 Easy problems per topic on LeetCode.

2. Month 2: Algorithms

   - Week 1: Sorting and Searching (Bubble, Quick, Merge, Binary Search)
   - Week 2: Recursion and Backtracking (Subset generation, permutations)
   - Week 3: Dynamic Programming (Basic problems like Fibonacci, Knapsack)
   - Week 4: Greedy Algorithms (Activity selection, Huffman coding)
   - Practice: Mix Easy and Medium problems (3-5 per topic).

3. Month 3: Complexity Analysis

   - Learn Big-O notation and apply it to all your solutions.
   - Analyze time and space complexities of solved problems.
   - Practice optimizing your solutions.
   - Practice: Solve Medium problems that focus on optimization.

### Phase 2: Intermediate Mastery (Months 4-8)

Objective: Master commonly asked interview topics and patterns.

1. Months 4-5: Advanced Data Structures

   - Graphs (DFS, BFS, Dijkstraâ€™s, Union-Find)
   - Trees (Binary Trees, BST, AVL, Segment Trees)
   - Tries (Auto-complete, prefix problems)
   - Heaps (Min-Heap, Max-Heap, Priority Queue)
   - Practice: Solve 3-5 Medium problems per topic.

2. Months 6-8: Algorithmic Patterns
   - Sliding Window
   - Two Pointers
   - Divide and Conquer
   - Dynamic Programming Patterns (Tabulation, Memoization)
   - Graph Traversal Patterns
   - Practice: Solve 3-5 problems for each pattern.

### Phase 3: Competitive Preparation (Months 9-12)

Objective: Prepare for ranked competitive challenges and enhance problem-solving speed.

1. Months 9-10: LeetCode Contest Preparation

   - Participate in weekly contests (at least 2-3 per month).
   - Solve problems in contest-like settings (timed practice).

2. Month 11: Problem Revisit

   - Revisit previously unsolved or difficult problems.
   - Optimize solutions for problems that were inefficient.

3. Month 12: Specialization and Practice
   - Focus on specific weak areas (e.g., DP, Graphs).
   - Attempt more Hard problems.
   - Participate in contests consistently.
